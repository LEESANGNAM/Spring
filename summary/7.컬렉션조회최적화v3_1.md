# 최적화 

## 컬렉션 조회 최적화 v3_1

+ OrderRepository
  + ToOne 관계를 모두 페치조인 한다.
  + 컬렉션은 지연로딩으로 조회한다.
  + 지연 로딩 성능 최적화를 위해 hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size 를 적용한다.
~~~java
public class OrderRepository {
   public List<Order> findAllWithMemberDelivery(int offset, int limit) {
      return em.createQuery(
                      "select o from Order o"+
                              " join fetch o.member m"+
                              " join fetch o.delivery d",Order.class)
              .setFirstResult(offset)
              .setMaxResults(limit)
              .getResultList();

### 장점
+ 쿼리 호출 수가 1+n에서 1+1로 최적화된다.
+ 페치 조인 방식과 비교해서 쿼리 호출 수가 증가하지만, DB 데이터 전송량이 감소한다.
+ 컬렉션 페치 조인은 페이징이 불가능 하지만 이방법은 페이징이 가능하다.
### 결과
+ ToOne 관계는 페치 조인해도 페이징에 영향을 주지 않는다. 따라서 ToOen 관계는 페치조인으로 쿼리 수를 줄이고 해결하고
나머지는 hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size 를 사용하여 최적화 하자.
